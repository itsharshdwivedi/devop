 Step 2: Initialize a Git Repository
1. Initialize an empty Git repository:
   ```
   git init
   ```

---

 Step 3: Create a File in the Folder
1. Create a file using any text editor or the command prompt. For example:
   ```
   echo "Hello, Git!" > filename.txt
   ```

---

 Step 4: Stage the File
1. Add the file to the staging area:
   ```
   git add filename.txt
   ```
   Or add all files in the folder:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

---

 Step 5: Commit the Changes
1. Commit the staged changes with a message:
   ```
   git commit -m "First commit"
   ```

---

 Step 6: Configure Git (if not done before)
1. Set your global username:
   ```
   git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
   ```
2. Set your global email address:
   ```
   git config --global user.email "YourEmail@example.com"
   ```

 Step 7: Create a Remote Repository on GitHub
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click the + icon in the top-right corner and select New repository.
3. Name your repository (e.g., `project-folder-name`) and click Create repository.

---

 Step 8: Link the Local Repository to the Remote Repository
1. Add the remote repository URL:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```

---

 Step 9: Set the Default Branch to Main
1. Rename the current branch to `main` (if not already named so):
   ```
   git branch -M main
   ```

---

 Step 10: Push the Changes
1. Push the changes to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

 Additional Commands for Git Branches
1. View All Branches:
   ```
   git branch
   ```
2. Create a New Branch:
   ```
   git branch branch-name
   ```
3. Switch to a Branch:
   ```
   git checkout branch-name
   ```
